      >This app operates on a subscription basis. Access to its features and
      content requires an active subscription, with charges recurring monthly as
      outlined during the sign-up process. You can manage or cancel your
      subscription at any time through your account settings. Please note that
      removing your payment details will immediately revoke access to your
      account. While we plan to introduce a free trial in the future, at this
      time, payment is required to begin using the service.</span
